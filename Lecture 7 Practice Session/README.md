# Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology - Lecture 7 Practice Session

In the practice session of lecture we will introduce you to field of artificial neural networks. We will have a look at the tensorflow python package, which helps us to generate neural networks in python and is one of the most important frameworks when it comes setup neural networks into code. In addition, we will model an artificial neuron use it for linear regression and binary classification tasks.


## Things you need

In this practice session we are using different jupyter notebooks:

1.  This chapter introduces the tensorflow package for python. The chapter is divided into several sections: After a short introduction dealing with the general concept of tensorflow, the most important tensorflow classes needed to generate neural networks are presented in their respective sections. In order to illustrate the usage of the described classes, programming examples are shown. This exercise is set up in a jupyter-notebook an can be started with the following command:

```
jupyter notebook 01_Tensorflow-Basic-Concepts.ipynb
```
2. The second practice session helps you to apply the concepts of the first notebook '01_Tensorflow-Basic-Concepts.ipynb' while simoultaneously deeping your understanding of the artificial neuron which was presented in the corresponding lecture. These two goals of this notebook are achieved by a mini linear regression project. In this mini project you will define an artificial neuron using tensorflow and train it to find a regression for a sample dataset in three dimensions. This exercise is set up in a jupyter-notebook an can be started with the following command:

```
jupyter notebook 02_Artificial-Neuron_Linear-Regression.ipynb
```

3. From the first two notebooks of this practical session, you will be familiar with basic tensorflow functionalities. Additionally, you have also learned how to conduct a linear regression in three dimensions by means of an artificial neuron. In this last part you will now perform a binary classification using a single artifical neuron, gradient descent and a sigmoid activation function. Because most concepts are already known from the two other parts of this practical session, explanations in this notebook are rather short. If you fail to understand the code or any remarks and annotations, please consult the previous notebooks. This exercise is set up in a jupyter-notebook an can be started with the following command:

```
jupyter notebook 03_Artificial-Neuron_Binary Classification.ipynb
```
