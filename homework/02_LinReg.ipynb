    "You have been given a linear regression model with polynomial basis functions. The coefficients are given as w0, w1 and w2. The mathematical description of the formular looks as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: You shall now programm a function, which evaluates the model prediction for arbitrary input data points. The input vector x for the data points can hold arbitrary many datapoints and is organized in form of a row vector. The parameter input is organized in form of a vector holding w0, w1 and w2 in this order. The function shall return the predicted output values based on the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Test cases: There is one test case. It is given below. You can check if your code fulfills the requirements by running the cell. It will output a true in case that the code matches the test case and a false otherwise. \n",

    "Question 2: In the Moodle test there are give values for x, w_0, w_1,w_2 and $\\hat{y}$. Is the give $\\hat{y}$ equal to the model prediction y?"
