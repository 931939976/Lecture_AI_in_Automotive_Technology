# Lecture Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology
This is the Github Repository that belongs to the lecture ["Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology"](https://www.ftm.mw.tum.de/index.php?id=1613&L=1) from the Institute of Automotive Technology of the Technical University of Munich.

In this Repository we will upload 13 different lectures that will teach you the foundations of Artificial Intelligence with regard to its use in automotive technology. Beside the lecture material we will upload here the coding examples we were using in the lecture. In addition to the material will find a video for each lecture.
