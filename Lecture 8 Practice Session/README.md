# Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology - Lecture 8 Practice Session

In the practice session of lecture 8 we will enhance our knowledge in thefield of artificial neural networks. We will take the tensorflow python package, which helps us to generate neural networks in python and is one of the most important frameworks when it comes setup neural networks into code. With this package we create and train a fully connected neural network for recognizing colored stars.




## Things you need


1.  Our neural network should take some image data x and output some image data y whith the recognized stars. For training the network we use the star dataset given with this lecture. The code for training and evaluting the neural network is set up in a jupyter-notebook an can be started with the following command:

```
jupyter notebook FullyStarNet.ipynb
```
