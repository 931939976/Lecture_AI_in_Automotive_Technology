# Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology - Lecture 2

In the practice session of lecture 2 we will define a special computer vision pipeline. The goal of the pipeline is to detect lane lines in images and video. We are using different images to check if we worked correctly and we are applying our Computer Vision Knowhow from lecture 2.
