# Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology - Lecture 6 Practice Session

In the practice session of lecture 6 we will show you and introduction you to the practical usage of pathfinding algorithms. We will generate a routable graph from a given satellite image and perform a Dijkstra-routing on this graph, finding the shortest possible route from a starting location to a destination! To achieve this, we will follow the steps of the routing process as illustrated in the lecture.



## Things you need

1. The whole exercise displays the usage of the Djisktra algorithm for pathfinding. Everything you need is explained in the jupyter notebook. The whole exercise is set up in a jupyter-notebook an can be started with the following command:

```
jupyter Pathfinding.ipynb
```
