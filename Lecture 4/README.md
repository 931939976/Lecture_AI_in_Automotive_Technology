# Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology - Lecture 4

In the practice session of lecture 4 we will show you and introduction to the practical usage of classification algorithms from the classical machine learning. In different examples we show you how to use the scikit learn toolbox for applying a classification algorithm to detect vehicles on the street.


## Things you need

1. The detailed description of how to use juypter notebook with a first example can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook Description](https://github.com/TUMFTM/Lecture_AI_in_Automotive_Technology/blob/master/Lecture%204/04_Practice_Session_4-Classification-Exercise.pdf)
2. The whole exercise displays the usage of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification of vehicles on the sreet. We define a dataset and different features for training the SVM. We apply this detection pipeline to different pictures and videos. You can start the exercise by executing the following command.
