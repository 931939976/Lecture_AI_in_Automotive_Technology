# Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology - Lecture 3

In the practice session of lecture 3 we will show you and introduction to the practical usage of linear regression. In different examples we show you how to use the scikit learn toolbox for applying linear regression.


## Things you need

1. The detailed description of how to use juypter notebook with a first example can be in the [Jupyter Notebook Description](https://github.com/TUMFTM/Lecture_AI_in_Automotive_Technology/blob/master/Lecture%203/00_Practice_Session_3-Regression-Exercise.pdf)
2. The first examples displays the usage of linear regression where three different methods of linear regression are used and applied.

```
jupyter 02_LinReg.ipynb
```
3. The second examples displays a real world example from automotive technology. We are using real world vehicle data (powertrain force and longitudinal acceleration) to detect the mass of the vehicle by using regression technologies.
