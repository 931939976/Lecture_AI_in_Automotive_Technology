# Artificial Intelligence in Automotive Technology - Lecture 5 Practice Session

In the practice session of lecture 5 we will show you and introduction to the practical usage of clustering algorithms from the classical machine learning. In a example with real life data we show you how to use the scikit learn toolbox for applying a clustering algorithm to analyze an unstructured dataset with GPS positions.



## Things you need

1. The whole exercise displays the usage of a DBSCAN algorithm for clustering. We have an unstructured dataset with 5k GPS positions of a bus.
Our goal is to compress the dataset to less than 100 representative points and extract the bus route. The whole exercise is set up in a jupyter-notebook an can be started with the following command:

```
jupyter Approximating_route.ipynb
```
